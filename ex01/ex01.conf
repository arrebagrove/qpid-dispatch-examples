# without specifyng any address, the distribution is "balanced" (messages are spread along receivers, in a "competing consumer" fashion)
 
# distribution "closest" and "balanced" are the same with more receivers connected to the same router
# because they are close at the same level. It means that router spreads messages one by one for each receiver.

# using distribution "multicast", all receivers will receive the messages (in a "publish/subscribe" fashion)
