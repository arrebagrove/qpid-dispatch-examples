Installation using Nginx as web server

1. Install Ngnix :
	dnf install nginx

2. Install following :
	dnf install python-websockify

3. Change "root" attribute in the Nginx configuration file at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf with the path to "stand-alone" files of console :
	i.e. /qpid-dispatch/console/stand-alone

4. Provide a listener to the router with "normal" role on a specific port (i.e. standard AMQP 5672)

5. Start the websockify in order to proxy calls from 5673 (websocket) to 5672 (tcp)
	websockify localhost:5673 localhost:5672

6. The console is available on http://localhost:80/

Docker

The fastest way to use the console is to run the docker image. Follow the installation/run instruction on that page.
